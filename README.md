## A little about me :thinking:
I was born in New York City but I grew up in Bogota, Colombia. At 19 years old I moved to the U.S. specifically Houston, Tx where I studied **Media Production**. During my time in Texas I worked as a videographer and video editor, I also did some graphic design work but I never had any formal training in that specific subject. I lived in Texas for almost 14 years before moving back to Colombia, it was there where I decided to go back to school and sharpen my design skills. Last year I decided to move to Calgary, AB and study at **SAIT University** where I'm persuing a diploma in _UX Design_. 

## My Professional background :nerd_face: 
For 11 years I worked on a small production company in Houston, Texas where I was hired as a videographer, later moved on to video editing specializing in motion graphics. At the same I was lucky enough to be able to do some freelancing where I worked with a couple of big companies like ***Igloo***. Corporate work was one of my main sources of income during that period of time. I've also worked in music videos, short films and small independent documentaries. I work primarily with Adobe CC software, specifically _Premiere Pro_ and _After Effects_. I'm fluent en both English and Spanish and have done translation projects such as transcripts, subtitles/Closed Captions, and article translations. 

## Fun Fact
I've never experienced a proper winter before since there's no stations in Colombia. 

## What I like to do on my free time :grin: 
:camera_flash: _Photography_ 
* Even though it's not my area of expertise, I fell in love with photography. It's similar enough to video that it helps me improve my cinematography skills, while at the same time different enough that it doesn't feel like I'm still at work.
  
:movie_camera: _Watch movies/TV shows_ 
* I love watching movies, since my background is video production I've always been a movie dork. My favorite movies are:
  - Back to the future (_the whole trilogy_)
  - Shaun of the Dead / Hot Fuzz (_couldn't decide which one I like better so they share a spot_)
  - Austin Powers Goldmember (_odd choice i know but it brings good memories of watching it with my brother_)
* I also love TV shows, when it comes to comfort shows I couldn't pick just one, even the top 4 was tough. My favorite ones are:
  - Parks and Recreation (_people usually say The Office but I do think Parks and rec is better_ :speak_no_evil:)
  - Community 
  - Brooklyn 99 
  - Ted Lasso 

:musical_note: _Listening to music_
 * I particulary enjoy live music, a good concert is always a good plan even if its just a small performance at a coffee shop. Live music hits different.
 * Won't list my favorite artist, there's simply not enough space on the internet. :sweat_smile:
