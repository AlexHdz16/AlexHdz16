## A little about me :thinking:
I was born in New York City but I grew up in Bogota, Colombia. I lived there until I was 19 years old then moved to the U.S. to go college. I lived in Texas for almost 14 years before moving back to Colombia, it was there where I decided to go back to school and sharpen my design skills. During my time in Texas I worked as a videographer and video editor, I also did some motion graphics but I never had any formal training in that specific subject. Last year I decided to move to Calgary and study at SAIT, it seemed like the best option and so far it has been a great desition. I do not have much experience with code and even though I feel a bit overwhelmed, I'm also willing to learn and hopefully be able to add it to my *"skills"* page on my resume. 

## My Profesional background :nerd_face: 
For 11 years I worked on a small production company in Houston, Texas where I was hired as a videographer, later moved on to video editor specializing in motion graphics. During covid I had to pivot to freelancing work where I was able to work with a couple of big comapnies like ***Igloo***. Corporate work was one of my main sources of income during that period of time. I've also worked in music videos, short films and small independent documentaries. I work primeraly with Adobe CC software, mainly _Premiere Pro_ and _After Effects_. 

## What I like to do for fun :grin: 
:movie_camera: _Watch movies/TV shows_
* I love watching movies, since my background is video production I've always been a movie dork. My favorite movies are:
  - Back to the future (_the whole trilogy_)
  - Shaun of the Dead / Hot Fuzz (_couldn't decide which one I like better so they share a spot_)
  - Austin Powers Goldmember (_odd choice i know but me and my brother used to die laughing watching it and brings good memories_)
* I also love TV shows, when it comes to comfort shows I couldn't pick just one, even the top 4 was tough. My favorite ones are:
  - Parks and Recreation (_people usually say The Office but I do think Parks and rec is better_)
  - Community (_no further explanation needed_)
  - Brooklyn 99 (_I mean its Andy Samberg_)
  - Ted Lasso (_Again no explanation needed_)

 :musical_note: _Listening to music_
 * My favorite genre of music has always been Punk Rock, but with time I've learned to appreciate other genres. The world is full of amazing artists and the idea of missing out on some incredible music just because it doesnt match my preferred genre seems pretty depressing to me.
 * I also enjoy live music, a good concert is always a good plan even if its just a small performance at a coffee shop. Live music hits different.
 * Won't list my favorite artist, there's not enough space on the internet. :shrug:
