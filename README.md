## A little about me :thinking:
I was born in New York City but I grew up in Bogota, Colombia. I lived there until I was 19 years old then moved to the U.S. to go college. I lived in Texas for almost 14 years before moving back to Colombia, it was there where I decided to go back to school and sharpen my design skills. During my time in Texas I worked as a videographer and video editor, I also did some motion graphics but I never had any formal training in that specific subject. Last year I decided to move to Calgary and study at SAIT, it seemed like the best option and so far it has been a great desition. I do not have much experience with code and even though I feel a bit overwhelmed, I'm also willing to learn and hopefully be able to add it to my *"skills"* page on my resume. 

## What I like to do for fun :grin: 
_Watch movies/TV shows_
* I love watching movies, since my background is video production I've always been a movie dork. My favorite movies are:
  - Back to the future (_the whole trilogy_)
  - Shaun of the Dead / Hot Fuzz (_couldn't decide which one I like better so they share a spot_)
  - Austin Powers Goldmember (_odd choice i know but me and my brother used to die laughing watching it and brings good memories_)
* I also love TV shows, when it comes to comfort shows I couldn't pick just one, it was hard enough to unlo pick 4. My favorite ones are:
  - Parks and Recreation (_people usually say The Office but I do think Parkc sand rec is better_)
  - Community (_no further explanation needed_)
  - Brooklyn 99 (_I mean its Andy Samberg_)
  - Ted Lasso (_Again no explanation needed_)
